Stuff for parsing Cargo.toml files.

Should be fully accurate as per the [reference](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html).

In the event the reference and the implementation diverge, I will make no attempt to fix anything until
the reference is properly updated.

Keeping track of undocumented changes is never a fun thing and I don't plan to do it. And it benefits no one to have a bunch of undocumented behaviour for `Cargo.toml`.

## Details

No validation or other work is performed on (De)Serialization.
It is up to you to:

* Ensure inputs are valid if you intend to Serialize.
* Set Default values for missing fields, if you want them.

Note that this is a pretty direct wrapper around the Cargo Manifest, and you should see the [Manifest Reference](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html) if you want to know what things mean.

## Limitations

Due to current limitations in `toml-rs`, Dependencies may fail to write out with a `ValueAfterTable` error.
As a workaround, if possible remove or convert the `Dependency::Simple` variants to `Dependency::Full` ones.
The relevant issue is [#256](https://github.com/alexcrichton/toml-rs/issues/265)

## FAQ

* Q: What about `cargo-toml`?
* A: ðŸ¤·. It didn't work for my needs, so I wrote my own.

----

* Q: Why call it `cargo-toml2`?
* A: `Cargo-toml` was taken, and I'm unimaginative. It's a simple obvious name that clearly states its purpose, what else could I make it? Sorry. Bit late to change after it's published.
