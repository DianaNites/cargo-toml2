Stuff for parsing Cargo.toml files.

Should be fully accurate as per the [reference](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html).
In the event the reference and the implementation diverge, I will make no attempt to fix anything until
the reference is properly updated.
Keeping track of undocumented changes is not something I will do.

## Details

No validation or other work is performed on (De)Serialization.
It is up to you to ensure inputs are valid if you intend to Serialize.

It is also up to you if you wish to have the default values of missing fields.

## Limitations

Due to current limitations in `toml-rs`, Dependencies may fail to write out with a `ValueAfterTable` error.
As a workaround, if possible remove or convert the `Dependency::Simple` variants to `Dependency::Full` ones.
The relevant issue is [#256](https://github.com/alexcrichton/toml-rs/issues/265)

## FAQ

* Q: What about `cargo-toml`?
* A: ðŸ¤·. It didn't work for my needs, so I wrote my own.

----

* Q: Why call it `cargo-toml2`?
* A: `Cargo-toml` was taken, and I'm unimaginative. It's a simple obvious name that clearly states its purpose, what else could I make it? Sorry. Bit late to change after it's published.
