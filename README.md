Stuff for parsing Cargo.toml files.

Fully accurate as per the [reference](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html).
In the event of any problems, nothing will be fixed until the reference is.
It just makes everything easier if the reference is accurate.

## FAQ

* Q: What about `cargo-toml`?
* A: ðŸ¤·.

* Q: Why call it `cargo-toml2`?
* A: `Cargo-toml` was taken, and I'm unimaginative. It's a simple obvious name that clearly states its purpose, what else could I make it? Sorry. Bit late to change after it's published.
